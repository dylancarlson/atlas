Atlas never really got far. It seemed to mostly be a way for John to implement his pet project
at the time: an auto-router. In the network used by systems derived from Dragon's Citadel, routing
e-mail from one user to another relied on sysops keeping track of network connections manually.
<p>John made the auto-router external to Atlas, and some people used it. However, with the advent of
an improved network protocol used by Gremlin's Citadel (and later Maven's Citadel), it became
unneeded. The coolest feature of Atlas however did make it into Gremlin's Citadel: Quack!<br><br>
