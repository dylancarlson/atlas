 Atlas Autorouter (NETROUTE.EXE) v1.02b
 A Citadel Mail Router
 By Angela Davis -- (206) 525-3683
 
 NETROUTE analyzes the paths in your MSG.DAT file and adjusts the ROUTE.CIT
file based on this path information.  It takes about seven minutes to run,
and functions well as a weekly CRON event.  NETROUTE will automatically
identify new nodes, and adjust to changing situations.  It will also
generate a unique #ALIAS for every node it sees.
 
 
 WHAT NETROUTE DOES AND HOW TO USE IT
 
 NETROUTE lets you keep your existing ROUTE.CIT format, while modifying it
based on how the messages on your board actually reach you.  It doesn't
disturb any of your ROUTE.CIT's comments and formatting unless it needs to
change the content of a route line.  New BBS's which it finds are appended
to the end of the ROUTE.CIT file.  New aliases are added before the routes.
 
 NETROUTE must be run in the same directory as the MSG.DAT and ROUTE.CIT
files.  If these files reside in different directories, NETROUTE can be
included in a batch file which copies ROUTE.CIT to the message directory,
runs NETROUTE, and copies the new ROUTE.CIT back where it belongs.
 
 
 COMMAND LINE SWITCHES
 
 /F turns on Full Mode.  Normally, NETROUTE dynamically adjusts its work to
take five minutes or less scanning the message file.  On a slower machine,
this may cause a few paths to be skipped.  You can avoid this--and force a
scan of the entire message file--using /F.  Example:
 
    NETROUTE /F
 
 
 /V turns on Verbose Mode.  This will tell you some trivia bits about what
NETROUTE is finding and doing.  Currently, this doesn't do much.  Example:
 
    NETROUTE /V
 
 
 ROUTE.CIT OPTIONS: LOCKING AND AVOIDING
 
 If you do not want NETROUTE to change a particular #ROUTE line, add the
word "LOCKED" to the end of the line, like this:
 
    #ROUTE "Tammy's Target BBS"     "Randy's Route"    LOCKED
 
 
 If you would prefer that your mail NOT pass through a particular BBS, you
can tell NETROUTE to avoid that BBS as much as possible.  To do so, add a
line like this to your ROUTE.CIT file:
 
    #AVOID "Sara's System"
 
 Good reasons for using this command include (1) when mail often
"disappears" when sent through the node, or (2) when the sysop of the node
does not respect the privacy of users' mail.  Only use #AVOID as a LAST
RESORT, because every use of it DEGRADES the effectiveness of your routes.
Also note that this command cannot avoid a node entirely.  It just favors
alternate routes if they exist.
 
 
 NOTES ON USING NETROUTE:
 
 * NETROUTE (and the whole network) works best when you share rooms with as
many nodes as possible.  This doesn't mean you should share every room with
every BBS your BBS calls.  But if you share "Jane's Room" with one node, and
if another node that you call has the same "Jane's Room", you should share
the room with both nodes.  This increases the speed and safety of the
network.  It also allows NETROUTE to choose the quickest and most dependable
routes.
